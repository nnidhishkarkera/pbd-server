Input will vary according to the user wishes to create the Reservation Days in.<br>\n\n**Examples:**\n* **(POST) /reservationdays** - create a bank Reservation Day<br>\n---\n\n## 3. _Update a bank Reservation Day_\nClients can update an existing bank Reservation Day record to change/edit information.
