		"description": "# Introduction\n### API for Scheduler Parameter(s) information belonging to specific banks which is available in PBD system.\n### Exposes endpoints to enable clients to _add, remove & modify_ bank Scheduler Parameter information. These endpoints, however, are access restricted and client must have the neccessary privileges to utilize them.\n### _Bank code_ wherever applicable for Scheduler Parameter(s) being interacted with using the below endpoints, is grabbed from the _request header_ unless specifically requested in the input parameters.\n\n# API summary with common use cases\n## 1. _List bank Scheduler Parameter available in PBD System_.\nClients can get a list of all the available Scheduler Parameter present with PBD for the bank for which the request is being made.\nResponse will contain all Scheduler Parameter with their basic information along with the `totalSize` and `nextPageToken` details.<br>\nThis endpoint contains a `view` input to specify how much details is expected in the response. More info can is given in the input specification.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **(GET) /schedulerparameter** - gets all Scheduler Parameter.\n* **(GET) /schedulerparameter?page-size=10&page-token=2** - gets 10 Scheduler Parameter from the 2nd page.\n* **(GET) /schedulerparameter?status=\"ACTIVE\"** - gets all Scheduler Parameter having active status.\n\n---\n\n## 2. _Create a bank Scheduler Parameter._\nThis operation is used to create Scheduler Parameter.\nClients can create and add a new bank Scheduler Parameter to their list of existing Scheduler Parameter.<br>\nEndpoint responds back with the new bank Scheduler Parameter upon successful creation with its ETag value in the response header.\nThis endpoint is access restricted and requires the user to have the proper privileges to perform this operation.\n\n**User Inputs:**<br>\nBank Scheduler Parameter details as part of request body. Input will vary according to the user wishes to create the Scheduler Parameter in.<br>\n\n**Examples:**\n* **(POST) /schedulerparameter** - create a bank Scheduler Parameter<br>\n---\n\n## 3. _Update a bank Scheduler Parameter_\nClients can update an existing bank Scheduler Parameter record to change/edit information. Complete bank Scheduler Parameter record is expected along the with the modified fields. If not provided it may result in failure or setting of default/NULL values in missing fields.<br>\nResponse contains the updated bank Scheduler Parameter record with its ETag value in response header.<br>\nThis too is an access restricted endpoint and requires the user to have the proper privileges to perform the operation.\n\n**User Inputs:**<br>\nBank Scheduler Parameter details as part of request body. Complete bank Scheduler Parameter details are expected to be sent.<br>\nSimilar to the create endpoint, the input for this endpoint varies according to the input of the Scheduler Parameter being updated. Examples can be found in the endpoint description below.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **(PUT) /schedulerparameter** - update a bank Scheduler Parameter with input details.<br>\n---\n\n## 4. _Read information for a single bank Scheduler Parameter_\nInformation for a specific bank Scheduler Parameter can be accessed via this endpoint. Response contains the complete data just for the requested Scheduler Parameter along with the ETag value in the response header.<br>\n\n**User Inputs:** (mandatory are marked with asterix)\n* `pk*`: Describes the pk of the Scheduler Parameter as query parameter.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **(GET) /schedulerparameter/10** - read a Scheduler Parameter with ID = 10\n---\n\n## 5. _Close/Delete a bank Scheduler Parameter_\nThis operation is used to close/delete Scheduler Parameter by Scheduler Parameter id.<br>\nThis endpoint can close/delete a Scheduler Parameter.\nSuccessful response will give complete information of Scheduler Parameter.<br>\n\n**User Inputs:** (mandatory are marked with asterix)\n* `pk*`:  Describes the pk of the Scheduler Parameter as query parameter.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **(DELETE) /schedulerparameter/10** - deletes a bank Scheduler Parameter of ID = 10\n---\n\n## 7. _Read all references for a specific Scheduler Parameter â€” `reference read`._\nThis can be used to read all references with complete information for a specific Scheduler Parameter. Its marked with a custom verb - `reference-read` because it can be used to read all the related references for a specific Scheduler Parameter.<br>\nScheduler Parameter is read based upon the combination of inputs `ref-key` and `ref-value`.<br>\n\n**User Inputs:** (mandatory are marked with asterix)\n* `ref-key*`: key to specify what criteria to read all the references by. Current possible value is: **reference-id**\n* `ref-value*`: value corresponding to the **ref-key** criteria\n\n**Examples:**\n* **(GET) /schedulerparameter/reference-id/20** - reads all available copies for a Scheduler Parameter with reference ID value of 20.\n* **(GET) /schedulerparameter/reference-id/20** - read an ACTIVE copy for a Scheduler Parameter with reference ID value of 20\n\n---\n\n# Error response information\n```\n{\n  \"system\": \"PBD\",\n  \"code\": \"3700\",\n  \"message\": \"Input error.\",\n  \"params\": null,\n  \"applicationSpecific\": {\n    \"severity\": \"INPUT_ERROR\",\n    \"logref\": \"b85946f2-3044-11e9-b210-d663bd873d93\",\n    \"message\": \"Input error.\",\n    \"validationErrors\": [\n      {\n        errorCode: 3700\n          errorMessage: page-size maximum value should not exceed 500.\n      }\n    ],\n    \"cause\": \"string\"\n      \"strackTrace\": \"string\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th align=\"left\">Field</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>system</td>\n    <td>The system short name.
